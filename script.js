// TOP's pseudocode steps

// Create a 16x16 grid first of square divs using JS (the space should be 960px wide)
// -> These sqaures should go inside a container div that can then go directly in the html
// -> This means that the container div will be a flex container to the squares (flex items)
// Add event listeners to every square such that when the mouse hovers over it, it changes the background color of the square
// Create a popup that allows users to enter a number for which a new grid with those dimensions can be generated
// -> Gives user opportunities to create new grids and drawings
